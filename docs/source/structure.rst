Structure of the PropertyTypes Repo
###################################

Ultimately there's a lot of property types used throughout an electronic
structure code. To make the user's life easier we have organized the property
types into groups. This page provides an explanation of the groups

============
AO Integrals
============

These are fundamental integrals computed in the AO basis set. Examples include:

- electronic kinetic energy
- electronic repulsion integrals (ERIs)
- AO overlap integrals

==============
Linear Algebra
==============

These are property types related to numeric linear algebra
