Installing SimDE
################

SimDE uses `CMaize <https://cmakepp.github.io/CMaize/index.html>`__ as
its build system, more detailed build instructions can be found
`here <https://cmakepp.github.io/CMaize/getting_started/building/index.html>`__.

.. note::

   We strongly recommend users use CMake toolchains to pass arguments to the
   ``cmake`` command. Typically CMake toolchains live in files named
   ``<prefix>-toolchain.cmake``, where ``<prefix>-`` is an optional prefix to
   distinguish among toolchains. The contents of the CMake toolchain file
   usually just sets configuration values set via the standard CMake ``set``
   function, *i.e.*, ``set(<option_name> <value>)``.

***************
Install Command
***************

In many cases SimDE can be installed by:

.. code-block:: console

   git clone https://github.com/NWChemEx/SimDE
   cd SimDE
   cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path/to/toolchain/file> \
                     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where/to/install/SimDE>
   cmake --build build --target install

Where ``<path/to/toolchain/file>`` should be replaced by the path to your
toolchain file, and ``<where/to/install/SimDE>`` should be replaced
with where you want to put the installed library (absolute path is recommended
in both cases).

.. note::

   The above command will build serially. To build SimDE with ``N``
   processors additionally pass ``--parallel <N>`` to the last command in the
   above code block, *i.e.*,

   .. code-block:: console

      cmake --build build --parallel <N> --target install

*********************
Configuration Options
*********************

This is a list of configuration options recognized by SimDE's build
system.

``BUILD_TESTING``.
   Off by default. Set to a truth-y value to enable testing.
``BUILD_DOCS``.
   Off by default. Set to a truth-y value to build the C++ API documentation.
   This variable is defined by the ``nwx_cxx_api_docs`` CMake module.
``ONLY_BUILD_DOCS``.
   Off by default. If ``BUILD_DOCS`` is set to a truth-y value and
   ``ONLY_BUILD_DOCS`` is also set to a truth-y value, then the configure
   process will skip all other aspects of the configuration aside from creating
   the ``simde_cxx_api`` target. This variable is defined by the
   ``nwx_cxx_api_docs`` CMake module.
``BUILD_PYBIND11_PYBINDINGS``.
  On by default. When enabled the optional Python API is built.
``ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES``.
  Off by default. When set to a truth-y value classes and functions which are in
  a pre-release state will be built.


******************
SimDE Dependencies
******************

If you have a problem building SimDE it's most likely because you
don't have a new enough version of CMake installed or because CMake can't find
one of SimDE's dependencies. This section enumerates SimDE's dependencies.

Required Dependencies
=====================

These are dependencies which must be pre-installed and can not be built by
SimDE's build system.

Boost
-----

SimDE's Chemist and PluginPlay dependencies need access to some of Boost's
header-only libraries. If SimDE is building either Chemist or PluginPlay then
SimDE will need to know where to find Boost. Boost is a very common C++
dependency so check your OS's package manager.

C++ Compiler
------------

SimDE relies on the C++17 standard and should work with any C++17
compliant compiler (GCC 9.x or newer). C++ compilers can often be installed by
your OS's package manager. CMake detects your C++ compiler via the value of
``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER``. So ensure ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`` is set to the C++
compiler you want to use.

MPI
----

SimDE's parallel runtime, ParallelZone,  implicitly brings in MPI (the message
passing interface). Users must have an MPI distribution
installed prior to building ParallelZone. MPI distributions exist in most
major OS-level package managers, so check your package manager before
installing MPI from source.While CMake can find MPI if it is installed in your
OS's standard spot, you may need to give CMake a hint in some cases. MPI
provides compiler wrappers and it's best to let CMake discover MPI via the C++
wrapper. Add:

.. code-block:: cmake

   set(MPI_CXX_COMPILER <path/to/mpicxx>)

to your toolchain to point CMake to MPI's C++ compiler wrapper.

Optional Dependencies
=====================

These are dependencies that SimDE's build system can not build; however,
they are only required if certain features are enabled.

Doxygen
-------

`Home Page <https://www.doxygen.nl/>`__

Used to generate the C++ API documentation. Only needed if ``BUILD_DOCS`` is
set to a truth-y value.

Python
------

Needed if ``BUILD_PYBIND11_PYTHONBINDINGS`` is enabled. You will need the
developer headers and libraries for Python.

Other Dependencies
==================

The dependencies in this section can be built by SimDE's build system
when they are not located. Under normal circumstances users can ignore them.
They are listed here primarily for completeness.

Catch2
------

URL: `<https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2>`__

Used for unit testing. Only needed if unit testing is enabled (controlled by
the CMake variable ``BUILD_TESTING``, which is ``OFF`` by default).


Chemist
-------

URL: `https://github.com/NWChemEx/Chemist`__

Provides the computational chemistry classes used to define the property types
contained in SimDE.

CMaize
------

URL: `<https://cmakepp.github.io/CMaize/index.html>`__

Used to simplify writing a CMake-based build system. The build system will grab
it for you.

ParallelZone
------------

URL: `<https://www.github.com/NWChemEx/ParallelZone>`__

Parallel runtime system built and maintained by the NWChemEx team. As a
slight caveat, SimDE's build system can only automatically build
ParallelZone if MPI is installed and visible to CMake.

PluginPlay
----------

URL: `<https://github.com/NWChemEx/PluginPlay>`__

Interfaces defined by SimDE are designed to be used as property types in the
PluginPlay framework.

TensorWrapper
-------------

URL: `<https://github.com/NWChemEx/TensorWrapper>`__

Provides a unified API to a number of tensor libraries. TensorWrapper is
currently under heavy development and not considered stable. It is only needed
when ``ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES`` is set to a truth-y value.

utilities
---------

URL: `<https://www.github.com/NWChemEx/utilities>`__

Utility classes used throughout the NWChemEx stack.
